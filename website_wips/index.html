We have an experienced battler working on the trainers, making them a good challenge for experienced players! Perhaps that sounds too intimidating to you, and simply want to enjoy the game without having to struggle too much? That is not a problem either, as the trainers' difficulty can be changed at any time!

						While music is something that's pretty standard for Pok√©mon fangames, it is rarely the case with Pixelmon. Not only did we area-specific music, but we've also added battle music. We thought that it was not enough, however, made battle themes customizable. Choose which themes you want to hear for your wild and trainer battles, and choose which theme your opponents will hear when they will battle you in PvP!
