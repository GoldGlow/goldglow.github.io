The most important part of this GUI for actually getting into scripting is the + button next to the “Settings” tab. Clicking this button will create a new tab with a number, and each of these new tabs is a new Script. Every tab’s script will be run, so these are more for organisation than anything. I’ll continue to explain the features of the Settings page, but if you wish to read the explanation on the Scripting GUI opened when you switch to a Script tab, just skip to the Scripting GUI explanation here.<br>
<br>
The large blank space taking majority of this GUI is the Console; If your script could talk, this is where you could read it’s tales. Or more specifically, this is where your scripts will either relay any information you tell them to print, or where your scripts will yell at you when something goes horribly wrong. (Errors are scary but can be simply read when you know what to look at)<br>
<br>
The Language button is probably not going to be used by you, but if you do ever have a reason to change the Scripting Language your scripts use, this is where you change that. By default this should be ECMAScript, and if nothing is here, tell someone because that means something went wrong outside of your control.<br>
<br>
Enabled, below the Language button, is pretty straightforward; If you want your script to run, click this and change it to Yes. If not, change it to No.<br>
<br>
Website, Forum, API Doc, and API Source are your shortcut buttons to webpages related to Scripting. The most useful being API Doc and Website. If you click API Doc, and click 1.12.2 (or whichever MC version we’re working with when you’re reading this), you’ll be taken to a site that shows you all the different classes and functions in the Scripting API. This will be intimidating at first, but I’ll explain how this can be helpful later on. The Website button takes you to the CNPC Scripting website which has some handy info that you will most likely use first and foremost, and we’ll be using this once we get into scripting.<br>
