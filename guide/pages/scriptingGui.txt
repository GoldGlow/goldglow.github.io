This right here is the GUI you'll spend the most time in whilst scripting. This is the Scripting GUI. The large blank area in this GUI is your text editor, where you'll be typing away your scripts, and upon leaving this GUI your script will be saved to whatever object you're attaching the script to, so no Save button necessary.<br>
<br>
Clear, Paste, and Copy are basic tools for editing. Copy and Paste are obvious, and clear wipes away all the text in the script for those times you just need to start over.<br>
Remove goes a step further than Clear and deletes this whole tab.<br>
<br>
Load Scripts is the area you'll most likely want to pay attention to, especially when working with pre-made scripts.<br>

Here you'll be able to see all Available Scripts that we have uploaded to the server, and what scripts you currently have loaded into this Script. Essentially, loading scripts into the current tab will mean they run along with whatever script you type into the text field of this tab. The arrow buttons will move either the selected script, or all scripts if you click a double arrow. Anything in the Loaded Scripts segment is what will be loaded into this tab's script.<br>
<br>
Most common scripting features that we say are Pre-made scripts can be found in this menu, and they should all work in any combination you need, so just load up the scripts for the given features you require, and follow any extra instructions that might be given for said script.<br>
<br>
That's the basic info you'll need for simply loading pre-made scripts and finding your way around the scripting GUI. But as good as pre-made scripts are, sometimes we want to do something more specific, which is when we need to get into actually writing scripts.<br>
