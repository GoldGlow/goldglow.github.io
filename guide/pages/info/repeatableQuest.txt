This is one of the more handy scripts for sidequests. This script allows you to set different dialogs for repeatable sidequests based on the state the quest is in.<br/>
<br/>
Parameters:<br/>
beforeId: (int) the dialog id before the player starts the quest. The player might've completed the quest already, but it means that it's available again.<br/>
duringId: (int) the dialog id shown when the player has that quest active. <br/>
waitingId: (int) the dialog id for when the player has completed the quest, and the cooldown to repeat the quest hasn't finished yet.<br/>
questId: (int) the id of the quest this script is associated with.
