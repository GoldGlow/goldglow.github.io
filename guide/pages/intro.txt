When it comes to scripting, there's one tool you'll want 24/7; The Scripter.<br>
The Scripter will allow you to edit the scripts of anything scriptable, pretty straightforward. But what *is* scriptable? For the most part you're probably going to be editing scripts on NPCs and Scripted Blocks, but scripts can also be attached to Players, and Forge events. (Though you probably won't need to worry about these)<br>
<br>
We'll cover what might best fit your case later on, but for now we should focus on how to actually edit scripts, so I'll just be working with an NPC. Right clicking our NPC with the Scripter equipped will open up the Scripting GUI, or more specifically the Settings page of the Scripting GUI.<br>
